    "Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and starts to fit the training data too closely. As a result, the model becomes too specialized and may not generalize well to new, unseen data. This can lead to poor performance on the test set and a lack of robustness in the model.\n",

A learning curve shows the performance of a model on both the training and validation data as a function of the amount of training data used. As more training data is used, the bias of the model tends to decrease while the variance tends to increase. The optimal tradeoff between bias and variance is achieved when the model has low bias and low variance, resulting in good generalization performance on new, unseen data."
