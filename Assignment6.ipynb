    "                       In the  example, Class A is the parent class and Class B is the child class since Class B inherits the features and behavior of the parent class A.\n",

    "                            In the example, class c inherits the properties and behavior of class B and class B inherits the properties and behavior of class B. So, here A is the parent class of B and class B is the parent class of C. So, here class C implicitly inherits the properties and behavior of class A along with Class B i.e there is a multilevel of inheritance.\n",

    "                            In the example, class A is base class means parent class. Class B and Class C inherits Class A that means Class B and C are child class of class A. This type of inheritance is called hierarchical inheritance."
