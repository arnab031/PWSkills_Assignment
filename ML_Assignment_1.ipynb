The algorithm tries to learn the relationship between the input variables and the target variable by mapping the input variables to the output variable using an appropriate model. The algorithm uses this model to predict the target variable of new input data.\n",

Unsupervised learning is often used for exploratory data analysis to gain insights into the data.\n",
